## Introduction
RESTFulLinq is an easy way to send LINQ queries to your API fluently

## Standard-Compliance
This library was built according to The Standard. The library follows engineering principles, patterns and tooling as recommended by The Standard.

This library is also a community effort which involved many nights of pair-programming, test-driven development and in-depth exploration research and design discussions.

## How to use this library
